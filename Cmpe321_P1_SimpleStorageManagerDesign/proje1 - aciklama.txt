Paper Design of a Simple Storage Manager for a DBMS

    * The deadline of the project is 12.04.2006 / Wednesday (17:00).
    * Specifications:
          o In this project you will design a simple storage manager. In the implementation of the storage manager the user will be able to make any of the following operations

            Table Operations:
             
                + Create a table of a certain type (fields of the table and the primary key will be determined by the user)
                + Delete a table.
                + List all the tables in the database.

            Record Operations:
             
                + Insert a record to a specified table.
                + Delete a record according to the primary key from a specified table.
                + List all records in a specified table.
                + Search for a record according to the primary key field.

       
          o You may assume that the type of each field is string

           
    * Submission: You should submit a report in paper format, including the following sections:                                      
          o Introduction-including your assumptions and a brief summary of your work
          o Data Structures-system catalog, table format, record format,page format...(draw figures for illustration)
          o Algorithms -write pseudocodes for table and record operations.
          o Conclusion- evaluate your work
