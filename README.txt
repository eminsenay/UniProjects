Here you can find most of the programming projects I've developed during the university time.
There are also some homeworks which don't have any associated source code and one exam, but I still included them.

Directory naming:

Cmpe<ABC>_<X>[_Y]

ABC: Course code
X: Project, assignment, homework, etc.
Y: Name of the project

There are also 2 directories with IE. These contain the simulation course project and assignments.

Intership_PictureApplet contains a Java applet I've developed during my internship at YKB. It is a simple image viewer applet.

EminSenay_UniProjects_C directory contains most of the projects I've developed using C/C++ as a programming language. It also contains VS solution for these projects.
