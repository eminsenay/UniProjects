	Description:I wrote a program which plays a number guessing game against human.
	There is a pool of numbers and each hint reduces the number of the
	pool members. Each time, the program controls all the pool members whether
	they fit the given clues or not. Numbers which do not fit the clues
	eliminated.Later, program chooses a random number from the remaining
	numbers.This process finish when the number is found. Lastly,
	the program asks if the player wants to play again or not.  */

/* Note:There are some digit controlling mechanisms I made.

	The first:
		If player enters the number of digits wrong, program warns
	the player and restarts.

	The second:
		Nowhere in the program can number of pluses and minuses more than
	digit number. After the program gets the plus and minus number from
	the player, it checks this first, and then starts to eliminate numbers.
	If player enters that values wrong, the program warns the player and
	shuts down.

	The third:
		If there is no	remaining number in the number array, the player must
	have entered one or more of hints incorrectly. In this situation,
	program again warns the	player and terminates. */
