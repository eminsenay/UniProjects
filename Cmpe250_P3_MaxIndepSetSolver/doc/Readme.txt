	The project consists of two seperate project folders."Graph Jenerator" folder contains "Generator.java" and "Main.java" whereas "Set Solver" folder contains "Vertice.java", "SetSolver.java" and "Main.java". Both folders contain "Runme.bat" files for easy execution.

	Running different algorithms on SetSolver is easy, too. The program asks you which algorithm/algorithms you want to run.

	g1-g7.dat are included both in mail and in cd but because of the big space requirement, additional a1-a7.dat graph files, which are used for a clearer algorithm analysis, are not included in the mail. They are in the cd.
