28.11.05 - ASSIGNMENT 1 

You will write a new system call that prints the PID of 
the process that is currently running. Note that, assuming you have a 
uni-processor system there is only one such process. You will also write 
a user-space test program to test it.
Due Date: 5th December 2005 Monday 12:00
You will submit:
1) A bootable diskette (or CD) that contains your modified kernel
2) Another diskette that contains your source codes and electronic copy 
of your report.
3) a single page report that technically summarizes what you did. (no 
source code inside)

Your source codes include:
a) changes you made in the kernel (just the changes not the whole kernel 
source code)
b) your user-space test program. This program will be a C program that 
learns its PID via existing system calls and prints it and then calls 
your new system call.
